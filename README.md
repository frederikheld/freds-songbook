# freds-songbook
A web app to serve as digital song book. You can install it on any webserver that runs PHP.

## For users
You can use the app *as is* at http://liederbuch.frederikheld.de/. You can also download the current version and put it on your own server. The only thing you need is PHP.

## For developers
If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to share your thoughts with you. You can also submit pull requests but sometimes a good discussion might help me more than big heaps of new code. Please keep in mind that the purpose of this project is learning. I want to improve on creating webapps and on playing the guitar. So let's do that together ;-)
The current development version is available at http://liederbuch.frederikheld.de/dev/. This might not represent the current state of the develop branch since it is updated directly from my local IDE.

### Development goals
* Mobile first. This is a web app that should work on smartphones and tablets, not on large screens. Responsiveness is still important.
* Camp fire compatibility. Imagine, people are using the app at the camp fire. What do they need for a good user experience?
* No database server required. The app is completely file based to keep the entry hurdle for users who want to put it on their own servers low. Keep in mind that they might be absolute beginners in web development!

### Discuss!
I'm happy to get your feedback on opinions on my work. Maybe they are bullshit, but then please let me know ;-)
