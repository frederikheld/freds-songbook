# freds-songbook

A web app to serve as digital song book. You can install it on any webserver that runs PHP.

## For users

You can use the app *as is* at [liederbuch.frederikheld.de](http://liederbuch.frederikheld.de/). You can also download the current version and put it on your own server. The only thing you need is PHP.

## For developers

If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/frederikheld/freds-songbook/pulls) or share your feedback and ideas in a new [issue](https://github.com/frederikheld/freds-songbook/issues).

### Development goals

* Mobile first. This is a web app that should work on smartphones and tablets, not on large screens. Responsiveness is still important.
* Camp fire compatibility. Imagine, people are using the app at the camp fire. What do they need for a good user experience?
* No database server required. The app is completely file based to keep the entry hurdle for users who want to put it on their own servers low. Keep in mind that they might be absolute beginners in web development!
