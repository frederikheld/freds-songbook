<h1>How to make a sheet</h1>
<h2>A quick introduction</h2>

<p>A sheet is just a txt file with some special formatting.</p>

<p>A song with chords can easily be set by placing the chords in square brackets right before the character it shall appear above:</p>

<code>[Bm]On a dark desert highway, [F#]cool wind in my hair
[A]warm smell of colitas [E]rising up through the air.</code>

<p>Please use international notation!<p>
<code>C C# D D# E F F# G G# A Bb B</code>
<code>Cm C#m Dm D#m Fm F#m Gm G#m Am Bbm Bm</code>
<code>Am7 G/C Fmaj7 ...</code>

<p>To specify, which kind of text is coming up, you can use the following <em>blockstart tags</em>:</p>
<code>{{intro#:}}
{{verse#:}}
{{chorus#:}}
{{bridge#:}}
{{outro#:}}
</code>
<p>Please replace the <em>#</em> sign by a running number for each block type!</p>
<p>The block has always to start right below the <em>blockstart tag</em> and ends with an empty line</p>

<p>A full block would look like this:</p>
<code>{{verse1:}}
[Bm]On a dark desert highway, [F#]cool wind in my hair
[A]warm smell of colitas [E]rising up through the air.
</code>

<p>You can also use <em>blockmarker tags</em> to repeat a block without having to type it again.</p>

<code>{{chorus1:}}
[G]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
Such a [em]lovely place, such a [Bm]lovely face.

{{verse1:}}
[Bm]On a dark desert highway, [F#]cool wind in my hair
[A]warm smell of colitas [E]rising up through the air.

{{chorus1}}
</code>

<p>The songbook will automatically insert the text of the <em>chorus1</em> block at the second marker. Please note, that the <em>blockmarker tags</em> don't have colon!</p>

<p>To add some more information to your sheet, you can use the following <em>meta tags</em>:</p>
<code>{{title:?}}
{{artist:?}}
{{original_artist:?}}
{{year:?}}
{{from:?}}
{{source:?}}
{{capo:?}}
</code>
<p>Please replace the <em>?</em> sign by the respective information. You don't have to use all <em>meta tags</em>, but <em>artist</em> and <em>title</em> are mandatory!</p>

<p>You can see the full magic in this <a href="sheets/summerwine.txt" target="_blank">example sheet</a>.</p>
